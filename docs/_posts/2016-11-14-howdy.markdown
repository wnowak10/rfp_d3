I wish I would have started writing down my thoughts long ago. Writing brought to us something that was only a fleeting memory before. Writing allows for deeper throughts. My writing may be random, infrequent, and riddled with spelling errors, but maybe it'll be helpful to me in the long run.

With love,
Dan Cole
